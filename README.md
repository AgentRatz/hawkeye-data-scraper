# hawkeye-data-scraper üèèü¶Ö
A repository in which I scrape [Indian Premier League (IPL)](https://www.iplt20.com/) Hawkeye data to extract relevant ball by ball information.

## Motivation
Cricket, like many other sports, is a complex game where strategic decisions can heavily influence outcomes. Hopefully, data is being used in some capacity to drive these decisions. Unfortunately, access to such detailed data isn't always available to the general public, despite its tremendous potential to unearth new insights.

This project came about because I wanted to dig deeper into IPL matches, gathering ball-by-ball data for completed IPL matches. By scraping this data and storing it neatly in CSV files (can be found in the *data* directory), I hope to make this dataset accessible to others who share a passion for cricket analysis.

## Features
- Scrapes bbb data of completed IPL 2024 matches.
- Stores data in an organized CSV files that can be used in analysis.

## To do üî®

1. Add data for IPL 2022, 23 and WPL (if available?)
2. Add information about the type of bowler (RF, OB, LB, etc.)
3. Add information about dismissals and their modes (runouts, obstructing the field are not currently recorded as wickets)
4. Add information about extras? (No information about legbyes, wides, etc.)
